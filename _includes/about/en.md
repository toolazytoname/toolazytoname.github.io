 I am a <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green;">programmer</span>
  with over a decade of experience, having <span style="font-size: 20px; color: green; font-weight: bold; ">worked</span> at various major internet companies in China.I’ve ridden the wave of the internet boom, witnessing its rise and fall—seeing grand buildings erected and lavish feasts hosted, only to watch it all fade with time. Eventually, I found myself caught in the tides of change, laid off in middle age. Perhaps the outcome was inevitable from the start. I’ve never been one to play office politics or engage in upward management. I simply focused on my work, taking responsibility for my code and myself. I thrive on creative and challenging tasks, driven by curiosity about the underlying principles of technology. I value work that produces tangible results and reject meaningless repetition—both in code and in life. I have a bit of a coding obsession and perfectionism, and I’m not particularly adept at navigating social intricacies. While I have my preferred technical interests, I admit I’ve only scratched the surface and need to dive deeper. I refuse to settle for a career that feels predictable and stagnant. There have been times when I’ve pushed myself to learn and grow, striving to excel, but also moments when I’ve lingered in my comfort zone, failing to keep up with self-improvement. It’s like two sides of a coin—a contradictory self.
 

My <span style="font-size: 20px; color: green; font-weight: bold; ">life</span> is simple. I’m not much of a socializer, and I don’t smoke or drink. I love the outdoors, road trips, and swimming. Wherever the free wind blows, you’ll find my footprints. Whether physically or mentally, I’m always on the move. My dream is to travel to the farthest corners of the world, to marvel at the wonders of nature and immerse myself in diverse cultures and traditions.


<span style="font-size: 20px; color: green; font-weight: bold;">Currently</span>, I’ve been grounded at home for over a year due to family responsibilities. This time has allowed me to reflect and introspect. I’m drawn to the freedom and decentralization of blockchain technology, and I’m equally amazed by the rapid advancements in AI. I firmly believe that everyone has a purpose, and that even if wealth is lost, it can be regained. I’ve had my share of setbacks in the crypto world—hacked by scammers and bitten by dubious projects. But I’ve also made some gains during the rise of Dogecoin and Bitcoin. I’m studying economic principles to broaden my understanding, aiming to build a viable product matrix that generates sustainable profits and ultimately leads to true freedom.
